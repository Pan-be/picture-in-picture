# Backgrounds App

This is a simple vanilla JavaScript app that retrieves and displays wallpaper images from the Pixabay API in an infinite scroll list. The app utilizes an endless scrolling technique to display images similar to popular social media websites. The app also features a loader that is displayed while the initial images are being loaded.
